This is a timed trial where I ask chatGPT to make me an entry level React frontend assignment. I have 30 minutes to complete it. The result will be posted as soon as the 30 minutes is up.

## Additional Info
There might be some time discrepancies within the commits. This is simply due to the fact that I ...
1) created the initial project in GitHub
2) installed React and did another commit to upload all the React files
3) I reorganized and got rid of some of the React files I didn't want. Then I committed again.
3) then took some time to refresh my mind on some last minute React concepts. This is the cause for the greatest discrepancy in the commit times. I assure you - however - I did not cheat or take more time than the challenge permits. When I start the timer, that is it. 30 nminutes and I am done. What I get is what I get.
4) took a while to type the rest of this README.

### Ending
I hope you enjoy this and get a little kick out of th progress I make over the next handful of attempts I make at this challenge.

# ALSO. Can't Forget The Prompt
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot... here is the Prompt

### User
Give me an entry level Front End React prompt that I would get in an interview

### ChatGPT
Sure, here's a typical entry-level Front End React prompt that you might encounter in an interview:

### Prompt: Build a Todo List App

### Description:

You are tasked with building a simple Todo List application using React. The application should allow users to add, delete, and mark todos as completed. Additionally, users should be able to filter todos based on their completion status (all, active, completed).

### Requirements:

Create a new React application.
Implement a Todo List component that displays a list of todos.
Each todo item should display the todo text, a checkbox to mark it as completed, and a button to delete it.
Implement functionality to add new todos to the list.
Implement functionality to mark todos as completed or uncompleted.
Implement functionality to delete todos from the list.
Add a filter bar with buttons to filter todos based on their completion status (all, active, completed).
Style the application to make it visually appealing.

### Bonus (Optional):

Implement local storage functionality to persist todos across page reloads.
Add animations or transitions to enhance the user experience.
Implement keyboard shortcuts for adding, completing, and deleting todos.

This prompt tests your understanding of React fundamentals such as component composition, state management, and event handling. It also evaluates your ability to design and style a user interface. Depending on your experience level, you can choose to implement additional features listed under the bonus section.
