# chatGPTFrontend1
This is a timed trial where I ask chatGPT to make me an entry level React frontend assignment. I have 30 minutes to complete it. The result will be posted as soon as the 30 minutes is up.

## Additional Info
There might be some time discrepancies within the commits. This is simply due to the fact that I ...
1) created the initial project in GitHub
2) installed React and did another commit to upload all the React files
3) I reorganized and got rid of some of the React files I didn't want. Then I committed again.
3) then took some time to refresh my mind on some last minute React concepts. This is the cause for the greatest discrepancy in the commit times. I assure you - however - I did not cheat or take more time than the challenge permits. When I start the timer, that is it. 30 nminutes and I am done. What I get is what I get.
4) took a while to type the rest of this README.

### Ending
I hope you enjoy this and get a little kick out of th progress I make over the next handful of attempts I make at this challenge.
